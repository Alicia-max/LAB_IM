# Behavioral Partial Least Square Correlation (PLSC) to analyze the role of different components in the CPM model

## Background

This repository contains the code and the report for a project conducted under the supervision of members of the [MIP:lab](https://miplab.epfl.ch/).\
The aim is to apply a multivariate statistical method (PLSC) to study the relationship between brain activity from fMRI films and emotional experience, focusing on both discrete emotions and appraisal.

Behavioral PLSC is a widely used technique for neuroimaging, as highlighted in a [review article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20656037/). This package has been largely adapted from the [Matlab toolbox] (https://github.com/valkebets/myPLS-1) and draws inspiration from a [Python interface for partial least squares (PLS) analysis] (https://github.com/valkebets/myPLS-1).
