# Behavioral Partial Least Square Correlation (PLSC) to analyze the role of different components in the CPM model

## Background
This repository contains the code and the report for the a project conducted under the supervision of members of the [MIP:lab](https://miplab.epfl.ch/).\ The aim is to apply a multivariate stasticial method (PLSC) to compare Appraisals and Discrete emotions PLSC analysis. This stastical method is used to predict the relationship bewteen two datasets and is widely for neuroimaging (Review [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20656037/])

classify fMRI brain images of subjects playing a video game that triggers predefined emotional states specified as the classes. Using different classification methods and visualization of the weights of the classifiers, this project allows to see which parts of the brain are responsible for a given emotional state.
